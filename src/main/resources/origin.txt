Computer networks are the backbone of the modern digital world, enabling seamless communication and data sharing among devices across the globe. At its core, a computer network is a collection of interconnected devices, such as computers, servers, routers, and switches, that exchange information using a common set of communication protocols.The fundamental components of a computer network include hardware, software, and protocols. Hardware devices like network interface cards, cables, and wireless access points provide the physical connection, while software such as operating systems and network management tools manage data flow. Protocols, including TCPIP, HTTP, and FTP, act as the language for devices to communicate, ensuring data is transmitted accurately and efficiently.
